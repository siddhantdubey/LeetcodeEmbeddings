# README

The embeddings.pkl file has a dataframe with 3 columns: 
- 'file name': this is the title slug of the leetcode problem e.g. 'two-sum'
- 'embedding': this is the embedding of the leetcode problem solution
- 'text': this is the text of the solution to the leetcode problem in C++ obtained from this [repository](https://github.com/kamyu104/LeetCode-Solutions).

The jupyter notebook contains some basic clustering you can play around with.
